# Machine-Learning
This repo contains work on Machine Learning with python. It basically contains codes on various topics of ML for further use on any big project.

## Description :-
This repo contains code that i've learnt from course on Machine Learning via Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wci/

##Purpose :-

1- Many of the codes shown in the lecture are not working because, everyday some updates are coming and hence new 
features or revision to existing fucntionalities happening all time. So, i've written working code on the topics taught in that course.

2- To learn Machine Learning codes from very basic step by step.

3- Use the codes from here to make cool and useful projects.
